## Project Overview

Web accessibility is a crucial aspect of modern web development. It not only ensures that a website is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities, but it also contributes to improved search engine rankings and helps businesses avoid legal issues related to accessibility compliance.

In this project, we have been tasked with refactoring an existing website to meet a set of specific accessibility criteria provided by the client. The primary goal is to enhance the website's user experience.

## Features

The project's success is determined by meeting the following acceptance criteria:

1. **Semantic HTML:** Ensure the use of semantic HTML elements to enhance the structure and meaning of the content.

2. **Accessible Images:** All images must have descriptive alternative text (alt text) to provide context for users who cannot see the images.

3. **Logical Heading Structure:** Implement a logical heading in a sequential structure to improve navigation and understanding for screen reader users.

4. **Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title** Give the webpage a descriptive title relating to its contents and usage.
